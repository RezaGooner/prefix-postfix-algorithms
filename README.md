# Prefix-Postfix Algorithms

This repository contains C++ implementations of **Prefix**, **Postfix**, and **Infix** expression conversion algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental for understanding how expressions are parsed and evaluated in computer science.

## Features
- **Prefix to Infix Conversion**
- **Postfix to Infix Conversion**
- **Evaluation of Postfix Expressions**

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RezaGooner/prefix-postfix-algorithms.git
```
Then compile and run the C++ code using your preferred IDE or command line:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o expression-converter
./expression-converter
```

## Example Usage
1. **Prefix to Infix**: Convert a prefix expression (e.g., `+ A B`) to its infix form `(A + B)`.
2. **Postfix to Infix**: Convert a postfix expression (e.g., `A B +`) to its infix form `(A + B)`.
